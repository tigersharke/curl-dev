This repo is intended to provide the contents of a FreeBSD ports tree leaf: /usr/ports/ftp/curl-dev so that those who desire may obtain and build their own. This will follow the github repo with updates as frequent as I am able, tied to commits there. My commits to be ONE day behind in order to avoid multiple commits of the same date.

Initially this effort is to clean up the Makefile (organize to my style) and try to solve the upstream Linux-autodetect installed software which presently seems to effectively disregard configured options. I believe the solution is to provide an "off" value as well as "on" or to use the /usr/ports/Mk mechanism which would do this. This means all options available might need to be defined in some way, or explicitly disabled the way a group of them have been in the official port Makefile. My usual philosophy of exposing all available options for config will follow eventually, as well as likely more frequent non-release updates from upstream git. I also plan for a mechaism to auto-set 'static' option if poudriere is installed or being built.
